<p id="text-color"> Many silk moths live a rather brief life living only two to five days. Many silk moths have evolved to mate and die or be part of the circle of life contributing to the food chain. In a silk moths short life the males preform a flutter dance in order to attract a female. after the female lays her eggs it takes around two weeks or fourteen days for the eggs to hatch in to silkworms. If the silkworm is able to survive they wrap themselfs into their silk caccon where the cycle begins again. </p>
